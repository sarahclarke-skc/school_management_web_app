School

An English-language school needs software to manage students, and register these students to classes.

MVP
The school needs to:
- create and edit members
- create and edit courses
- enrol students on specific courses
- show a list of upcoming courses
- show a list of students booked onto a specific course

DO NOT MOVE ON UNTIL THIS WORKS AND LOOKS OK!!!

Extensions:
- Courses have a maximum capacity and students can only be added whilst there is space remaining.
- The DB has current and former students, with former students not appearing when creating bookings.
- Once students have completed X number of hours, they automatically move up a level.
- Current students also have free access to socials.
- Add a Teacher class, with teachers assigned courses to teach.
- Teachers can also teach individual students. 
- Teachers can't exceed 22 hours of teaching time per week.
