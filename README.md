# Solo project for CodeClan, built to practise the technologies learnt over the previous weeks - Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, Jinja2.

The brief was to build an English-language school management app, where school admin could keep track of student data, add, view, and delete course details, and add students onto courses.

To run:
- Clone and run under Flask at http://localhost:5000
